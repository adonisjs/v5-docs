summary: The application module of AdonisJS is responsible for booting the app and managing its lifecycle.
---

The application module of AdonisJS is responsible for booting the app in different known environments.

When you start the HTTP server from the `server.ts` file or run the `node ace serve` command, the application is booted for the **web** environment.

Whereas running the `node ace repl` command boots the application in the **repl** environment. All other commands boot the application in the **console** environment.

The environment of the application plays an essential role in deciding which actions to perform. For example, The **web** environment does not register or boot the Ace providers.

You can access the current environment of the application using the `environment` property. Following is the list of known application environments.

- `web` environment refers to the process started for the HTTP server.
- `console` environment refers to the Ace commands except for the REPL command.
- `repl` environment refers to the process started using `node ace repl` command.
- `test` environment refers to the process started using the `node ace test` command.

```ts
import Application from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'
console.log(Application.environment)
```

## Boot lifecycle

Following is the boot lifecycle of the application.

You can access the IoC container bindings once the application state is set to `booted` or `ready`. An attempt to access the container bindings before the booted state results in an exception.

For example, if you have a service provider who wants to resolve the container's bindings, you should write the import statements inside the `boot` or the `ready` methods.

:::caption{for="error"}
Top-level import will not work
:::

```ts
import { ApplicationContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'
import Route from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route'

export default class AppProvider {
  constructor(protected app: ApplicationContract) {}

  public async boot() {
    Route.get('/', async () => {})
  }
}
```

:::caption{for="success"}
Move import inside the boot method
:::

```ts
import { ApplicationContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'

export default class AppProvider {
  constructor(protected app: ApplicationContract) {}

  public async boot() {
    const { default: Route } = await import('@ioc:Adonis/Core/Route')
    Route.get('/', async () => {})
  }
}
```

## Version

You can access the application and the framework version using the `version` and `adonisVersion` properties.

The `version` property refers to the version inside the `package.json` file of your app. The `adonisVersion` property refers to the installed version of the `@adonisjs/core` package.

```ts
import Application from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'

console.log(Application.version!.toString())
console.log(Application.adonisVersion!.toString())
```

Both the version properties are represented as an object with the `major`, `minor`, and the `patch` sub-properties.

```ts
console.log(Application.version!.major)
console.log(Application.version!.minor)
console.log(Application.version!.patch)
```

## Node environment

You can access the node environment using the `nodeEnvironment` property. The value is a reference to the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. However, the value is further normalized to be consistent.

```ts
import Application from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'

console.log(Application.nodeEnvironment)
```

| NODE_ENV | Normalized to | 
|------------|----------------|
| dev | development |
| develop | development |
| stage | staging |
| prod | production |
| testing | test |

Also, you can make use of the following properties as a shorthand to know the current environment.

### inProduction
```ts
Application.inProduction

// Same as
Application.nodeEnvironment === 'production'
```

---

### inDev
```ts
Application.inDev

// Same as
Application.nodeEnvironment === 'development'
```

---

### inTest
```ts
Application.inTest

// Same as
Application.nodeEnvironment === 'test'
```

## Make paths to project directories
