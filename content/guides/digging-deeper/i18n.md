The `@adonisjs/i18n` official package adds support for [internationalization and localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) to your AdonisJS applications.

- The internationalization helpers allow you to perform language-sensitive formatting of specific values such as **date, currency, and name**.
- The localization layer allows you to store translations and reference them within the Edge templates, validation errors, auth exceptions, and so on.

The I18n (shorthand for Internationalization) package must be installed and configured separately.

## Usage
Following is a basic example of importing the installed package and formatting values.

:::note
The `I18n.locale` method returns an instance of [I18n](https://github.com/adonisjs/i18n/blob/develop/src/I18n/index.ts) class for a specific locale. The locale code must be a valid [ISO 639-1](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) standard language code.
:::

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n.locale('en-US').formatDate(new Date())
// 10/8/2021

I18n.locale('fr').formatCurrency(100, { currency: 'EUR' })
// 100,00 €

const luxonDate = DateTime.local().minus({ minutes: 10 })
I18n.locale('pt').formatRelativeTime(luxonDate, 'auto')
// há 10 minutos
```

You can make use of the `formatMessage` method to format stored translations. The method accepts the message key as the first argument and the data as the second argument.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n
  .locale('en-US')
  .formatMessage('messages.greeting', { name: 'Virk' })
```

### Usage during HTTP requests
It is recommended to use the `ctx.i18n` object during the HTTP requests. It is an isolated instance of [I18n](https://github.com/adonisjs/i18n/blob/develop/src/I18n/index.ts) class for the current request.

```ts
Route.get('/', async ({ i18n }) => {
  return i18n.formatCurrency(100, { currency: 'EUR' })
})
```

By default, the locale of `ctx.i18n` is set to the application default locale. Therefore, it is recommended to use the [DetectUserLocale](#detecting-user-locale) middleware to find the user locale and update it for the rest of the request.

## Config
The configuration is stored inside the `config/i18n.ts` file. You can always find the up-to-date [config stub on GitHub](https://git.io/Jw53K).

```ts
import Application from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'
import { I18nConfig } from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

const i18nConfig: I18nConfig = {
  translationsFormat: 'icu',
  defaultLocale: 'en',

  // Optional
  supportedLocales: [],
  fallbackLocales: {},

  provideValidatorMessages: true,
  loaders: {
    fs: {
      enabled: true,
      location: Application.resourcesPath('lang'),
    },
  },
}

export default i18nConfig
```

#### translationsFormat
The format to be used for formatting translations. Officially only the [ICU messages format](https://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/index.html) is supported.

---

#### defaultLocale
The `defaultLocale` is the default language of your application. It is always static and cannot be changed at runtime. We look up translations from the default locale when the current user language is not supported, and also, there is no fallback available.

```ts
const i18nConfig: I18nConfig = {
  defaultLocale: 'en'
}
```

---

#### supportedLocales
It is an array of ISO 639-1 formatted language codes that your application supports. If the user language is not mentioned inside this array, we will use the `defaultLocale` to look up translations.

You can optionally define the `supportedLocales` inside the config file. Otherwise, we will infer the supported locales from the language directories you have created inside the `resources/lang` directory.

```ts
const i18nConfig: I18nConfig = {
  supportedLocales: ['fr', 'en', 'it']
}
```

---

#### fallbackLocales
The `fallbackLocales` is a key-value pair of the locales that your application supports along with their fallback locales.

For example: Using Spanish as a fallback for the Catalan language makes more sense than using English. Therefore, you can define the fallback locales yourself.

:::note
The locale for which you have defined the fallback should be part of the `supportedLocales` array.
:::

```ts
const i18nConfig: I18nConfig = {
  fallbackLocales: {
    ca: 'es'
  }
}
```

---

#### provideValidatorMessages
Enable/disable the support for providing validator messages through translation files. The messages are provided when the flag is set to `true`.

Learn more about [translating validation messages](#validator-messages).

---

#### loaders
The `loaders` are used to load messages from some sort of storage. Officially we ship with an implementation of `fs` loader that loads `.json` or `.yaml` files from the filesystem.

## Locale matching
We allow you to define translations for a specific region or use a two-digit language code for generic support.

For example: If you store the translations for the French language inside the `fr` directory, then all variations of the french language will see the same messages.

However, if you create region-specific directories such as `fr-ca` or `fr-ch`, the translations from the best matching locale will be served.

The style of locale matching is known as content negotiation. Instead of looking for the exact match, we negotiate for the closest match.

### Finding the best matching locale
You should use the `I18n.getSupportedLocale` method to find the best locale for the user language. 

The method accepts a string or an array of user languages and returns the matching locale supported by your application. `null` is returned when no match is found.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

const userLanguage = 'en-US'
const bestMatch = I18n.getSupportedLocale(userLanguage)

if (bestMatch) {
  I18n.locale(bestMatch).formatMessage()
} else {
  I18n.locale(I18n.defaultLocale).formatMessage()
}
```

---

### Detecting user locale
You should use the `DetectUserLocale` middleware stored inside the `app/Middleware` directory to find the locale for the incoming HTTP request.

By default, the middleware uses the [Accept-language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) HTTP header to find the language of the user's browser. 

However, you can change the implementation of this middleware and use any strategy that fits your use case and application needs. Just keep the following points in mind.

- Make sure always to pass the user-selected locale to the `I18n.getSupportedLocale(userLocale)` method to find the best possible locale supported by your application.
- If a match is found, call the `ctx.i18n.switchLocale(locale)` method to switch the locale for the rest of the request.

Also, make sure to register the middleware inside the `start/kernel.ts` file.

```ts
// title: start/kernel.ts
Server.middleware.register([
  // ... other middleware(s)
  () => import('App/Middleware/DetectUserLocale')
])
```

**Check out this [example project](https://github.com/adonisjs-community/i18n-language-switcher) that uses the in-application language switcher and sessions for managing the user preferred language.**

## Translations storage
The `fs` (default) loader looks for the translations inside the `resources/lang` directory. You must create a sub-directory for every locale that your application supports. For example:

:::note
The language directory must be named after a valid [ISO 639-1](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) language code
:::

```txt
resources/lang
├── en
└── fr
```

The loader will read all the `.json` and `.yaml` files. Also, feel free to create multiple sub-directories or files inside a language directory.

```txt
resources/lang
├── en
│   ├── emails.yaml
│   └── validator.json
└── fr
    └── validator.json
```

```json
// title: resources/lang/fr/validator.json
{
  "shared": {
    "required": "Ce champ est requis"
  }
}
```

```yaml
// title: resources/lang/en/emails.yaml
welcome:
  content: >-
    <h2> Welcome to AdonisJS </h2>
    <p> Click <a href="{ url }"> here </a> to verify your account </p>
```

## Formatting translations
The `icu` formatter lets you write translations using the [ICU messages format](https://format-message.github.io/icu-message-format-for-translators/index.html). It is an industry-standard format for writing translations and is supported by many translation services like Crowdin and Lokalise.

Given the following message inside the `en/messages.json` file.

```json
// title: resources/lang/en/messages.json
{
  "title": "A fully featured web framework for Node.js."
}
```

You can render it as follows.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'
I18n.locale('en').formatMessage('messages.title')
```

And render it inside templates using the `t` helper method.

```edge
<h1> {{ t('messages.title') }} </h1>
```

### Interpolation
The ICU messages syntax uses a single curly brace for referencing dynamic values. For example:

:::note
The ICU messages syntax [does not support nested data sets](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/pull/2039#issuecomment-951550150) and hence you can only access properties from a flat object during interpolation.
:::

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello { username }"
}
```

```edge
{{ t('messages.greeting', { username: 'Virk' }) }}
```

You can also write HTML within the messages. However, do make sure to use three [curly braces](../views/templating-syntax.md#curly-braces) within the Edge templates to render HTML without escaping it.

### Number format
You can format numeric values within the translation messages using the `{key, type, format}` syntax. In the following example:

- The `amount` is the runtime value.
- The `number` is the formatting type. 
- And the `::currency/USD` is the currency format with a [number skeleton](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/numbers/skeletons.html#overview)

```json
{
  "bagel_price": "The price of this bagel is {amount, number, ::currency/USD}"
}
```

```edge
{{ t('bagel_price', { amount: 2.49 }) }}
```

```
The price of this bagel is $2.49
```

Following are some examples using the `number` format with different formatting styles and number skeletons.

```
Length of the pole: {price, number, ::measure-unit/length-meter}
```

```
Account balance: {price, number, ::currency/USD compact-long}
```

### Date/time format
You can format the [Date]() instances or the [luxon DateTime]() instances using the `{key, type, format}` syntax. In the following example:

- The `expectedDate` is the runtime value.
- The `date` is the formatting type. 
- And the `medium` is the date format.

```json
{
  "shipment_update": "Your package will arrive on {expectedDate, date, medium}"
}
```

```edge
{{ t('shipment_update', { expectedDate: luxonDateTime }) }}
```

```
Your package will arrive on Oct 16, 2021
```

Similarly, you can use the time format to format time for the current locale.

```json
{
  "appointment": "You have an appointment today at {appointmentAt, time, ::h:m a}"
}
```

```txt
You have an appointment today at 2:48 PM
```

#### Available date/time skeletons

ICU provides a [wide array of patterns](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/datetime/#date-field-symbol-table) to customize date-time format. However, not all of them are available via ECMA402's Intl API. Therefore, we only support the following patterns.

| Symbol |  Description |
|------|------------------|
| `G` | Era designator   |
| `y` | year   |
| `M` | month in year  |
| `L` | stand-alone month in year  |
| `d` | day in month   |
| `E` | day of week  |
| `e` | local day of week e..eee is not supported |
| `c` | stand-alone local day of week c..ccc is not supported |
| `a` | AM/PM marker   |
| `h` | Hour [1-12]  |
| `H` | Hour [0-23]  |
| `K` | Hour [0-11]  |
| `k` | Hour [1-24]  |
| `m` | Minute   |
| `s` | Second   |
| `z` | Time Zone |

### Plural rules
ICU message syntax has first-class support for defining the plural rules within your messages. For example:

:::note

In the following example, we use YAML over JSON since it is easier to write multiline text in YAML.

:::

```yaml
cart_summary:
  "You have {itemsCount, plural,
    =0 {no items}
    one {1 item}
    other {# items}
  } in your cart"
```

```edge
{{ t('messages.cart_summary', { itemsCount: 1 }) }}
```

```
You have 1 item in your cart.
```

The `#` is a special token to be used as a placeholder for the numeric value. It will be formatted as `{key, number}`.

```edge
{{ t('messages.cart_summary', { itemsCount: 1000 }) }}

<!-- Output -->
<!-- You have 1,000 items in your cart -->
```

#### Available plural categories

The plural rule uses the `{key, plural, matches}` syntax. The `matches` is a literal value and is matched to one of the following plural categories.

| Category | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `zero` | This category is used for languages with grammar specialized specifically for zero number of items. (Examples are Arabic and Latvian) |
| `one` | This category is used for languages with grammar explicitly specialized for one item. Many languages, but not all, use this plural category. (Many popular Asian languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not use this category.) |
| `two` | This category is used for languages that have grammar explicitly specialized for two items. (Examples are Arabic and Welsh.) |
| `few` | This category is used for languages with grammar explicitly specialized for a small number of items. For some languages, this is used for 2-4 items, for some 3-10 items, and other languages have even more complex rules. |
| `many` | This category is used for languages that have a specialized grammar for a more significant number of items. (Examples are Arabic, Polish, and Russian.) |
| `other` | This category is used if the value doesn't match one of the other plural categories. Note that this is used for "plural" for languages (such as English) that have a simple "singular" versus "plural" dichotomy. |
| `=value` | This is used to match a specific value regardless of the plural categories of the current locale. |

Table: The table's content is referenced from [formatjs.io](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/#plural-format)

### Select
The `select` format allows you to choose the output by matching a value against one of the many choices. Writing gender-specific text is an excellent example of the `select` format.

```yaml
// title: Yaml
auto_reply:
  "{gender, select,
    male {He}
    female {She}
    other {They}
  } will respond shortly."
```

```edge
{{ t('messages.auto_reply', { gender: 'female' }) }}
```

```
She will respond shortly.
```

### Select ordinal
The `select ordinal` format allows you to choose the output based upon the ordinal pluralization rules. The format is similar to the `plural` format. However, the value is mapped to an ordinal plural category.

```yaml
anniversary_greeting:
  "It's my {years, selectordinal,
    one {#st}
    two {#nd}
    few {#rd}
    other {#th}
  } anniversary"
```

```edge
{{ t('messages.anniversary_greeting', { years: 2 }) }}
```

```txt
It's my 2nd anniversary
```

#### Available select ordinal categories
The select ordinal format uses the {key, selectordinal, matches} syntax. The match is a literal value and is matched to one of the following plural categories.

| Category | Description |
|------------|------------|
| `zero` | This category is used for languages with grammar specialized specifically for zero number of items. (Examples are Arabic and Latvian.) |
| `one` | This category is used for languages with grammar explicitly specialized for one item. Many languages, but not all, use this plural category. (Many popular Asian languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not use this category.) |
| `two` | This category is used for languages that have grammar explicitly specialized for two items. (Examples are Arabic and Welsh.) |
| `few` | This category is used for languages with grammar explicitly specialized for a small number of items. For some languages, this is used for 2-4 items, for some 3-10 items, and other languages have even more complex rules. |
| `many` | This category is used for languages with specialized grammar for a larger number of items. (Examples are Arabic, Polish, and Russian.) |
| `other` | This category is used if the value doesn't match one of the other plural categories. Note that this is used for "plural" for languages (such as English) that have a simple "singular" versus "plural" dichotomy. |
| `=value` | This is used to match a specific value regardless of the plural categories of the current locale. |

## Intl formatters
The Intl formatters are thin wrappers over the [Node.js Intl API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/intl.html). Creating a new instance of the Intl classes is slow, so we memoize the constructors to speed up things. [See benchmarks](https://github.com/poppinss/intl-formatter#benchmarks)

### formatNumber
The `formatNumber` uses the [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat) class to format a numeric value.

- The first argument is the value to format. It must be a number, bigint, or a string representation of a number.

- The second argument is the options. They are the same as the options accepted by the `Intl.NumberFormat` class.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatNumber(123456.789, {
    maximumSignificantDigits: 3
  })
```

### formatCurrency
The `formatCurrency` method uses the `Intl.NumberFormat` class but implicitly sets the `style` to currency.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatCurrency(200, {
    currency: 'USD'
  })
```

### formatDate
The `formatDate` method uses the [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) class to format a date.

- The first argument is the date to format. It can be an `ISO date string`, a `timestamp`, an instance of the JavaScript `Date` class, or a luxon `DateTime`.

- The second argument is the options. They are the same as the options accepted by the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` class.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatDate(new Date(), {
    dateStyle: 'long'
  })
```

### formatTime
The `formatTime` method uses the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` class, but implicitly sets the `timeStyle` to medium.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatTime(new Date(), {
    timeStyle: 'long'
  })
```

### formatRelativeTime
The `formatRelativeTime` method using the [Intl.RelativeTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat/RelativeTimeFormat) class to format a value to a relative time representation string.

- The first argument is the value of the relative time. It can be an `ISO date string`, an absolute numeric diff, an instance of the JavaScript `Date` class, or an instance of luxon `DateTime`.

- The second argument is the formatting unit. Along with the [officially supported units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/RelativeTimeFormat/format), we also support an additional `auto` unit.

- The third argument is the options. They are the same as the options accepted by the `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` class.


```ts
import { DateTime } from 'luxon'
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

const luxonDate = DateTime.local().plus({ hours: 2 })
I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatRelativeTime(luxonDate, 'hours')
```

We will find the best unit when using the formatting unit is set to `auto`. For example:

```ts
const luxonDate = DateTime.local().plus({ hours: 2 })
I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatRelativeTime(luxonDate, 'auto')

// In 2 hours 👈
```

```ts
const luxonDate = DateTime.local().plus({ hours: 200 })
I18n
  .locale('en')
  .formatRelativeTime(luxonDate, 'auto')

// In 8 days 👈
```

### formatPlural
The `formatPlural` method uses the [Intl.PluralRules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules/PluralRules) and returns a plural category for a given numeric value.

- The first argument is the value. It must be a number or a string representation of a number.

- The second argument is the options. They are the same as the options accepted by the `Intl.PluralRules` class.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

I18n.locale('en').formatPlural(0)
// other

I18n.locale('en').formatPlural(1)
// one

I18n.locale('en').formatPlural(2)
// other
```

## Validator messages
Following are steps to configure the `i18n` package to provide the validation messages from the translations files.

1. Set the value of `provideValidatorMessages = true` inside the config file.
2. Create a `validator.json` file inside every language directory.
3. Define messages for the validation rules inside the `shared` object.

```json
// title: resources/lang/en/validator.json
{
  "shared": {
    "required": "The value for the field is required",
    "unique": "Email is already in use",
    "minLength": "The field must have { minLength } items"
  }
}
```

The messages from the `shared` key are automatically provided to the validator. You can also be specific and define a message for a `field + rule` combination. For example:

```json
{
  "shared": {
    "required": "The value for the field is required",
    // highlight-start
    "username.required": "Username is required to create an account"
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```

### Custom messages bag
If some part of your application needs specific validation messages, you can define them within the `validator.json` file under a different top-level key and then reference them using the `i18n.validatorMessages()` method.

```json
// title: resources/lang/en/validator.json
{
  "shared": {},
  "contact": {
    "email.required": "Enter the email so that we can contact you",
    "message.required": "Describe your project in a few words."
  }
}
```

Now, you can reference the messages from the `contact` object on the validator as follows.

```ts
import { schema } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Validator'
import { HttpContextContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext'

export default class ContactValidator {
  constructor(protected ctx: HttpContextContract) {}

  public schema = schema.create({})

  // highlight-start
  public messages = this.ctx.i18n.validatorMessages('validator.contact')
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Auth messages
You can also provide translations for the exceptions raised by the [auth](../auth/introduction.md) package. The translations must be defined inside the `auth.json` file using the exception code as the translation key.

:::note

The translations are used for the response text and not the `error.message` property. They will still be in English and hardcoded.

:::

```json
{
  "E_INVALID_AUTH_SESSION": "Your session has expired",
  "E_INVALID_API_TOKEN": "Invalid or expired API token",
  "E_INVALID_BASIC_CREDENTIALS": "Invalid credentials",
  "E_INVALID_AUTH_UID": "Invalid credentials",
  "E_INVALID_AUTH_PASSWORD": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

## Translating emails
Since emails are usually sent in the background (outside of the HTTP request lifecycle), you must explicitly pass the `i18n` instance to the email templates.

The `t` helper method is an alias for the `i18n.formatMessage`, it will format messages in the same language for which you created the `i18n` class instance and passed it to the template state.

```ts
import Mail from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/Mail'
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

// highlight-start
const i18n = I18n.locale(customerLocale)
// highlight-end

await Mail.send((message) => {
  message
    // highlight-start
    .subject(i18n.formatMessage('emails.welcome_subject'))
    .htmlView('emails/welcome', { i18n })
    // highlight-end
})
```

## Reloading translations
The translations are loaded and cached within the memory on the application start. Therefore, any changes you make to the translation files are not reflected until you restart the process. 

During development, the dev server will restart itself on file change. However, in production, you will have to restart the server manually (like a new deployment).

If for some reason, you want to reload the translations within the running process, then you can make use of the `I18n.reloadTranslations()` method to do it.

```ts
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

await I18n.reloadTranslations()
```

## Reporting missing translations
To help you progressively add translations for new languages, we report the missing translations by emitting the `i18n:missing:translation` event.

Create a new preload file `start/i18n.ts` by running the following Ace command. Select all the environments.

```sh
node ace make:prldfile i18n
```

Open the newly created file and paste the following contents inside it. Currently, we are using the `I18n.prettyPrint` method to log the message to the console. However, you can also use the logger to log the message.

```ts
// title: start/i18n.ts
import Event from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Event'
import I18n from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

Event.on('i18n:missing:translation', I18n.prettyPrint)
```

## Add custom message formatter
The message formatter defines the syntax and the capabilities of the stored translations. The package ships with an `icu` formatter that uses the ICU messages syntax for writing translations.

However, you can also register a custom message formatter using the `I18n.extend` method. The formatter implementation must adhere to the [TranslationsFormatterContract](https://github.com/adonisjs/i18n/blob/develop/adonis-typings/i18n.ts#L87) interface.

```ts
interface TranslationsFormatterContract {
  readonly name: string
  format(message: string, locale: string, data?: Record<string, any>): string
}
```

#### name
A unique name for the formatter. It will be a static string value.

---

#### format
The format method receives the following arguments and must return a formatted string.

- The first argument is the message text.
- The second argument is the `locale` for which the formatting should happen.
- Finally, the data object for dynamic values.

### Dummy implementation

Following is a very straightforward implementation that uses the Edge template engine for formatting translations.

#### Step 1. Create formatter class.
Create a new file `MustacheFormatter.ts` within the `providers` directory and paste the following contents inside it.

```ts
import type { ViewContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/View'
import type { TranslationsFormatterContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

export class MustacheFormatter implements TranslationsFormatterContract {
  public readonly name = 'mustache'
  constructor(private view: ViewContract) {}

  public format(message: string, _: string, data?: Record<string, any>) {
    return this.view.renderRawSync(message, data)
  }
}
```

#### Step 2. Extend I18n and register the formatter
Open the `providers/AppProvider.ts` file and register the formatter within the `boot` method.

```ts
// title: providers/AppProvider.ts
import { ApplicationContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'
// highlight-start
import { MustacheFormatter } from './MustacheFormatter'
// highlight-end

export default class AppProvider {
  constructor(protected app: ApplicationContract) {}

  public register() {
    // Register your own bindings
  }

  // highlight-start
  public async boot() {
    const I18n = this.app.container.resolveBinding('Adonis/Addons/I18n')
    const View = this.app.container.resolveBinding('Adonis/Core/View')

    I18n.extend('mustache', 'formatter', () => new MustacheFormatter(View))
  }
  // highlight-end

  public async ready() {
    // App is ready
  }

  public async shutdown() {
    // Cleanup, since app is going down
  }
}
```

#### Step 3. Use the `mustache` formatter
Update the config file and set the `translationsFormat` to mustache.

```ts
{
  translationsFormat: 'mustache'
}
```

## Add custom messages loader
The message loader is responsible for loading the messages from a permanent source. The package ships with an `fs` formatter that reads the `.json` and `.yaml` files from the file system.

However, you can also register custom loaders using the `I18n.extend` method. The loader implementation must adhere to the [LoaderContract](https://github.com/adonisjs/i18n/blob/develop/adonis-typings/i18n.ts#L79) interface.

```ts
type Translations = {
  [lang: string]: Record<string, string>
}

interface LoaderContract {
  load(): Promise<Translations>
}
```

Loaders only need to implement a single method called `load` that returns all the translations as an object.

The top-level keys of the object are the language codes, and the value is another object of messages. 

```ts
{
  en: {},
  fr: {},
  it: {}
}
```

Also, make sure to convert nested messages inside a language object to a flat object. For example:

```ts
{
  en: {
    'messages.title': '',
    'messages.subtitle': ''
  }
}
```

### Dummy implementation
Following is a very straightforward implementation that reads the messages from the Database using Lucid.

#### Step 1. Create the loader class.
Create a new file `DbLoader.ts` within the `providers` directory and paste the following contents inside it.

```ts
import type { DatabaseContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Database'
import type {
  Translations,
  LoaderContract
} from '@ioc:Adonis/Addons/I18n'

export type DbLoaderConfig = {
  enabled: boolean
  table: string
}

export class DbLoader implements LoaderContract {
  constructor(private db: DatabaseContract, private config: DbLoaderConfig) {}

  public async load() {
    const rows = await this.db.from(this.config.table)

    return rows.reduce<Translations>((result, row) => {
      result[row.locale] = result[row.locale] || {}
      result[row.locale][row.key] = row.message
      return result
    }, {})
  }
}
```

#### Step 2. Extend I18n and register the loader
Open the `providers/AppProvider.ts` file and register the loader within the `boot` method.

```ts
// title: providers/AppProvider.ts
import { ApplicationContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/Application'
// highlight-start
import { DbLoader } from './DbLoader'
// highlight-end

export default class AppProvider {
  constructor(protected app: ApplicationContract) {}

  public register() {
    // Register your own bindings
  }

  // highlight-start
  public async boot() {
    const I18n = this.app.container.resolveBinding('Adonis/Addons/I18n')
    const Db = this.app.container.resolveBinding('Adonis/Lucid/Database')

    I18n.extend('db', 'loader', (_, config) => {
      return new DbLoader(Db, config)
    })
  }
  // highlight-end

  public async ready() {
    // App is ready
  }

  public async shutdown() {
    // Cleanup, since app is going down
  }
}
```

#### Step 3. Use the `db` loader
Update the config file and add the `db` loader key to the `loaders` object.

```ts
{
  loaders: {
    fs: {},
    db: {
      enabled: true,
      table: 'translations'
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4. Create translations table
Use the following migration to create the translations table.

:::note
When running the migration, you will have to disable the `db` loader inside the config file. Otherwise, the loader will attempt to read the messages from a non-existing table.
:::

```ts
import BaseSchema from '@ioc:Adonis/Lucid/Schema'

export default class Translations extends BaseSchema {
  protected tableName = 'translations'

  public async up() {
    this.schema.createTable(this.tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments('id')
      table.string('locale', 8).notNullable()
      table.string('key').notNullable()
      table.text('message', 'longtext').notNullable()

      table.timestamp('created_at', { useTz: true })
      table.timestamp('updated_at', { useTz: true })

      table.unique(['locale', 'key'])
    })
  }

  public async down() {
    this.schema.dropTable(this.tableName)
  }
}
```
