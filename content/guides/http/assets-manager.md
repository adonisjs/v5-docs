summary: The assets manager module allows referencing compiled frontend assets in your edge templates.
---

AdonisJS makes use of [webpack encore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@symfony/webpack-encore) to compile and serve the frontend assets. Webpack Encore is a wrapper on top of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to make it easier to work with the Webpack config.

:::note

AdonisJS is a backend framework and does not concern itself directly with the frontend build tools.

You are free NOT to use Webpack Encore and set up the frontend build tools yourself, and everything will still work.

:::

## Getting started

Creating a new AdonisJS application also prompts you to configure webpack encore. However, setting it up afterward is also relatively simple. Just run the following ace command.

```sh
node ace configure encore
```

The following actions are performed to set up webpack encore:

- Install `‌@symfony/webpack-encore` npm package.
- Create a default `webpack.config.js` file.
- Create `resources/js/app.js` and `resources/css/app.css` files as the first entry point to your frontend application.

## Compiling frontend assets

Once the encore has been configured, the pre-existing commands of AdonisJS will detect it and process your frontend assets as part of the following commands.

---

#### node ace serve --watch

The `node ace serve --watch` command will also run the [webpack dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) within the same process to compile and serve the frontend assets.

![Log lines prefixed with "encore" are from the webpack-dev-server](https://res.cloudinary.com/adonis-js/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/v1617015453/v5/encore-dev-server.png)

---

#### node ace build --production

Similarly, the `node ace build --production` command will also run the `encore production` command to bundle the frontend assets alongside your AdonisJS build.

---

### Customizing output directory

By default, the compiled assets are written to the `./public/assets` directory so that AdonisJS static file server can serve them.

However, you can customize and define any output directory by updating the `webpack.config.js` file.

The `setOutputPath` method accepts a path relative to the project root. Also, make sure to update the public URL prefix using the `setPublicPath` method.

```ts
// Write file to this directory
Encore.setOutputPath('./public/assets')

// Prefix the following to the output URL
Encore.setOutputPath('/assets')
```

### Disable assets compilation

You can disable webpack assets compilation by defining the `--no-assets` flag to the `serve` and the `build` commands.

```sh
node ace serve --watch --no-assets
node ace build --productions --no-assets
```

## Customize dev server port and host
Webpack dev server runs on `localhost:8080` by default. If the port is in use, AdonisJS will find a random port to start the webpack dev server. However, you can also define a custom port using the `--encore-args` flag.

```sh
node ace serve --watch --encore-args="--port 5000"
```

As of now, you cannot define the port for the webpack dev server inside the `webpack.config.js` file. This is the limitation enforced by the [symfony encore package](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore/issues/941#issuecomment-787568811).

## Assets view helpers

Depending upon your webpack config, the output files may not have the same as the input file. For example, The `Encore.enableVersioning()` method appends the file hash to the output file name.

Hence, it is recommended to never hardcode the file names in your templates and always use the `asset` helper.

#### ❌ Not recommended

```edge
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    // highlight-start
  <script src="/assets/app.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/app.css">  
    // highlight-end
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

#### ✅ Instead use the `asset` helper

```edge
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  // highlight-start
  <script src="{{ asset('assets/app.js') }}"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ asset('assets/app.css') }}">  
    // highlight-end
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

The `asset` helper relies on the `manifest.json` file generated by the encore to resolve the actual URL. You can use it for all the assets, including JavaScript, CSS, fonts, images, and so on.

## Manifest file

Encore generates the `manifest.json` file inside the `public/assets` directory. This file contains a key-value pair of the file identifier and its URL.

```json
{
  "assets/app.css": "http://localhost:8080/assets/app.css",
  "assets/app.js": "http://localhost:8080/assets/app.js"
}
```

The `asset` view helper resolves the URL from this file itself.

## Entrypoints

Every webpack bundle always has one or more [entrypoints](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#entry-points). Any other imports inside the entry point file are part of the same bundle. 

For example, if you have registered the `./resources/js/app.js` file as an entry point with the following contents, all the internal imports will be bundled together to form a single output.

```ts
import '../css/app.css'
import 'normalize.css'
import 'alpinejs'
```

You can define these entry points inside the `webpack.config.js` file using the `Encore.addEntry` method. The first argument is the entry point name, and 2nd is the path to the entry point file.

```ts
Encore.addEntry('app', './resources/js/app.js')
```

### Multiple entry points

Most applications need a single entry point unless you are building multiple interfaces in a single codebase. For example: Creating a public website + an admin panel may require different entry points as they will usually have different frontend dependencies and styling altogether.

You can define multiple entry points by calling the `Encore.addEntry` method multiple times.

### Reference entry points inside the template files

You can make use of the `@entryPointStyles` and the `@entryPointScripts` tags to render the script and the style tags for a given entry point.

The tags will output the HTML with the correct `href` and `src` attributes. The `./public/assets/entrypoints.json` file is used to look up the URLs for a given entry point.

```edge
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  @entryPointScripts('app')
  @entryPointStyles('app')
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

## Setup PostCSS

The first step is to install the [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) from the npm registry as follows:

```sh
npm i -D postcss-loader
```

Next, create the `postcss.config.js` file to configure PostCSS.

```ts
// title: postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {}
}
```

And finally, enable the PostCSS loader inside the `webpack.config.js` file.

```ts
Encore.enablePostCssLoader()

// Pass options
Encore.enablePostCssLoader((options) => {
  options.postcssOptions = {
    config: path.resolve(__dirname, 'custom.config.js')
  }
})
```

## Setup SASS, Less, and Stylus

To configure the CSS pre-processors, you must uncomment the following lines of code inside the `webpack.config.js`

```ts
// Enables SASS
Encore.enableSassLoader()

// Enables Less
Encore.enableLessLoader()

// Enables Stylus
Encore.enableStylusLoader()
```

Also, make sure to install the appropriate loaders for them.

```sh
# For SASS
npm i -D sass-loader sass

# For Less
npm i -D less-loader less

# For Stylus
npm i -D stylus-loader stylus
```

## Copying & referencing images
Webpack cannot automatically scan/process the images referenced inside an edge template. Hence, you have to tell the webpack in advance to copy the images from a specific directory.

You can use the `copyFiles` method to copy the images to the build output.

```ts
Encore.copyFiles({
  from: './resources/images',
  to: 'images/[path][name].[hash:8].[ext]',
})
```

Also, make sure to use the `asset` helper to reference the image inside an `img` tag.

```edge
<img src="{{ asset('logo.png') }}" />
```

## Configuring Babel

Babel is pre-configured for all files with `.js` and `.jsx` extensions using [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader).

You can further configure babel using the `Encore.configureBabel` method.

```ts
// title: webpack.config.js
Encore.configureBabel((babelConfig) => {
  babelConfig.plugins.push('styled-jsx/babel')
  babelConfig.presets.push('@babel/preset-flow')
}, {
  exclude: /node_modules/
})
```

### Configuring browser targets

You can configure the browser targets for [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env) inside the `package.json`.

```json
{
  "browserslist": [
    "> 0.5%",
    "last 2 versions",
    "Firefox ESR",
    "not dead"
  ]
}
```

### Using the `.babelrc` file

Instead of calling `configureBabel()`, you can also use the standard `.babelrc` file. However, this approach has a downside: as soon as a `.babelrc` file is present, Encore can longer configure babel for you, and the `.babelrc` file becomes the single source of truth.


## Configuring React

You can configure React by installing react preset for babel from the npm registry.

```sh
npm i -D @babel/preset-react
```

Next, enable the react preset inside the `webpack.config.js` file.

```ts
Encore.enableReactPreset()
```

:::warning

If you are using the `.babelrc` file, you must enable the react preset inside it, as Encore can no longer configure babel.

:::

## Configuring Vue
You can configure Vue by first enabling the vue loader inside the `webpack.config.js` file. 

:::codegroup

```ts
// title: Vue2
Encore.enableVueLoader(() => {}, {
  version: 2
})
```

```ts
// title: Vue3
Encore.enableVueLoader(() => {}, {
  version: 3
})
```

:::

Next, install the following required dependencies for Vue2 or Vue3.

:::codegroup

```sh
// title: Vue2
npm i vue vue-loader @vue/compiler-sfc
```

```sh
// title: Vue3
npm i vue@next vue-loader@next @vue/compiler-sfc
```

:::

You can define the [vue-loader options](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/options.html) by passing a callback to the `enableVueLoader` method.

```ts
Encore.enableVueLoader((options) => {
  options.transformAssetUrls = {
    video: ['src', 'poster'],
    source: 'src',
    img: 'src',
    image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],
    use: ['xlink:href', 'href']
  }
})
```

The encore specific options can be defined as the third argument.

```ts
Encore.enableVueLoader(() => {}, {
  version: 3,
  runtimeCompilerBuild: false,
  useJsx: true
})
```

#### version
The VueJS version to use. You can opt between `vue2` and `vue3`.

---

#### runtimeCompilerBuild
You must disable runtime compiler build when using single-file components and do not want to use the string-based templates.

---

#### useJsx
Enable/disable the support for JSX inside your Vue templates. 

- You cannot enable the option with Vue3.
- Also, you need to install `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` and `@vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props` dependencies when using JSX.

## Adding custom webpack loaders
Encore does a pretty good job in encapsulating the setup for the most common use cases. It also allows you to set up custom loaders using the `addLoader` method.

```ts
Encore
  .addLoader({
      test: /\.handlebars$/,
      loader: 'cson',
  })
```

Similarly, you can also add plugins using the `addPlugin` method.

```ts
const NpmInstallPlugin = require('npm-install-webpack-plugin')
Encore.addPlugin(new NpmInstallPlugin())
```
